This repository contains laboratory and practice files developed as part of the Digital Image Processing subject taught by Dr. Tapan Jain. The work focuses on implementing fundamental image processing operations using MATLAB, including image acquisition, grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement through histogram equalization, binary image generation using thresholding, and basic color channel manipulation. The objective of this subject is to build a clear understanding of core image processing techniques through hands-on experimentation and code-based analysis, forming a strong foundation for advanced image analysis and vision-related applications.
